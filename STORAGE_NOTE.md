# Storage Note - Optional Feature

**Status**: Storage not enabled (requires billing plan)

---

## ✅ Good News!

**Storage is optional** for the core functionality! We can proceed without it.

### What Works Without Storage:
- ✅ Authentication (admin login)
- ✅ Firestore Database (form submissions, data storage)
- ✅ News management
- ✅ Events management
- ✅ Admin panel functionality

### What Requires Storage:
- File uploads (admission documents)
- Gallery image uploads
- News image uploads

## 🎯 Solution: We Can Add Storage Later

When you're ready to enable Storage:
1. Enable billing in Firebase Console (Blaze plan - pay as you go)
2. Storage free tier: 5GB storage, 1GB/day downloads
3. Very affordable for small websites
4. Can enable anytime

**For now**, we'll:
- Set up everything else
- Make Storage optional in code
- Add file uploads later when Storage is enabled

## ✅ Continue Setup

Since Firestore and Authentication are enabled, we can proceed with:
1. Getting Firebase configuration
2. Updating config file
3. Initializing Firebase
4. Deploying rules
5. Creating admin user

**Storage will be added later when you're ready!**
